        <p> over the weekend A list rapper and self proclaimed "Jay -Z" of chicago lil durk, lost his brother in an act of sensles violence.
            the inncident happened in chicago where Durks brother Dthang is a famous club/concert promoter. is been speculated that the shooting was instigated by new song on 
            lil durk and lil baby collaborative album (voice of the Heroes). The song still running appears to throw subliminal shots at the rappers dead rivals including
            Quando rondo, Fbg wooski and Fbg Duck. the song suprised some as Durk recently stated he will no longer perpetuate the trend of taunting dead rivals on songs.
            
        </p>
        <p> While it has not been yet proven  that the song is indeed the reason for th unprovoked killing of D thng the streets speculate that this is the cause.
            This could be the case because people can unfoutrnaley be guilty by association. This is just a sad case overall and what ever is the cause there needs to be a solution and fast. 
            the solution is not just one of policy but also one in mentalities shifting. its not cool to kill someones family memeber who had nothing to do with the streets and it
            also should not be the norm and cool to disrespect someones dead relative especially in something as importal as a song. Hopefully things will get better.

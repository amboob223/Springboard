        <h2> Crypto usage study</h2>
        <p> There has been much debate and discussion around crypto currencie enviromental impact. Because the many currencies use a proof of work
            procesing system. The sytem relies on nodes to verify transactions. This makes transactions trustless which makes bitcoin work. The nodes 
            all require energy for the computers that do the computations and verify transactions. The amount of energy this require can be massives. There are 
            large facilities just dedicated to mining currencies as well as indivdual miners who keep the computer running nononstop to generate more currency rewards from 
            mining currency. 
        </p>
        <p> Even though this is alot of power it is the main catalyst for why one could say that bitcoin and other currecnies are detrimental to the enviroment,
            but what about fiat currency. Fiat currency is traditional paper money. The implicit cost is the cost of making the money and it ciruclating as well as the papaer and the money have to pay for the people pringing the money and the fed for detrmininig how much to put in circulation.
            they are also paying for the cost of fuel to circulate the money to all the banks the hold reserves. these cost will be measured in this reprot amd we will see which one consumes more energy  </p>
